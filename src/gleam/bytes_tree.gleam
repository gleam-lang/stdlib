//// `BytesTree` is a type used for efficiently building binary content to be
//// written to a file or a socket. Internally it is represented as tree so to
//// append or prepend to a bytes tree is a constant time operation that
//// allocates a new node in the tree without copying any of the content. When
//// writing to an output stream the tree is traversed and the content is sent
//// directly rather than copying it into a single buffer beforehand.
////
//// If we append one bit array to another the bit arrays must be copied to a
//// new location in memory so that they can sit together. This behaviour
//// enables efficient reading of the data but copying can be expensive,
//// especially if we want to join many bit arrays together.
////
//// BytesTree is different in that it can be joined together in constant
//// time using minimal memory, and then can be efficiently converted to a
//// bit array using the `to_bit_array` function.
////
//// Byte trees are always byte aligned, so that a number of bits that is not
//// divisible by 8 will be padded with 0s.
////
//// On Erlang this type is compatible with Erlang's iolists.
